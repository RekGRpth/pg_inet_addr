pg_inet_addr
============

**pg_inet_addr** is an extension that lists interface addresses. The addresses
will be IPv4 and IPv6 addresses assigned to interfaces.

PostgreSQL local connections does not list IP addresses via `inet_server_addr`.
Function `pg_inet_addr` provides all interface addresses even if you are not
using a remote connection.

Installing
----------

Build and install is done using PGXS. PostgreSQL 9.1+ installed (including the
header files). As long as `pg_config` is available in the path, build and
install using:

```
$ make
$ make install
```

Usage
-----

```
mydb=# CREATE EXTENSION pg_inet_addr;
CREATE EXTENSION
